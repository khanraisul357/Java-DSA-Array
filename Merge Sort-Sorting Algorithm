Best Case(sorted/nearly sorted & middle element is pivot)-->Time Complexity = O(n log n)
Average Case(random order & random element is pivot)-->Time Complexity = O(n log n)
Worst Case(reversed order/reverse sorted & first or last element is pivot)-->Time Complexity = O(n^2)

Best Case(sorted/nearly sorted) select middle element as pivot or select pivot through median-of-3 for sorted,nearly sorted array.
Average Case(random order/unsorted array) select random element as pivot.
Worst Case(reversed order/reverse sorted) select pivot through median-of-3 or random element as pivot to avoid worst-c
